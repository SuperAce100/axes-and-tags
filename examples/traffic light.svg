    TRAFFIC LIGHT OUTLINE SVG

    Concept: A classic upright traffic light with three round lights (red, yellow, green) in a vertical stack.
    - All strokes are 2px solid black, no fill.
    - No overlaps: each shape is spaced to prevent intersection of outlines.
    - Style: Outline only, no coloring.
  -->

  <!--
    TRAFFIC LIGHT BODY

    - A tall rounded rectangle representing the main enclosure for the traffic signal.
    - Positioned centrally, with rounded corners, and sized to allow comfortable spacing for circles and margins.
    - Dimensions: x=40, y=40, width=100, height=250, rx=22 for corners.

  <!--
    TRAFFIC LIGHT POLE

    - A vertical rectangle extending from below the body to serve as the supporting pole.
    - Aligned to center of the body, thin compared to body.
    - Carefully positioned to avoid any overlaps with the body.
    - Dimensions: x=78, y=290, width=24, height=90, rx=7 for slight rounding.

  <!--
    LIGHT HOUSINGS (Red, Yellow, Green)

    - Three equal circles, each placed evenly along the vertical axis inside the main body.
    - Spaced apart to ensure outline strokes do not overlap.
    - Each circle: radius=28, centers: (90,80), (90,165), (90,250)

    SIDE VISORS (HOODS)

    - Subtle suggestion of sun visors above each light on the left and right, as short arc lines.
    - Made from simple short arcs (left and right per light)
    - Do not overlap circles or body outline.

    Left side visors: arcs above each circle, extend leftwards.
    Right side visors: arcs above each circle, extend rightwards.
    Use SVG arc path with minor offset.

    BASE FLANGE
