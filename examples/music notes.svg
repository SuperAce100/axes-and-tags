    MUSIC NOTES OUTLINE SVG

    Concept: Musical notes (eighth note + beamed pair) in outline style.
    - Eighth note (single stem and flag) and a beamed pair (two notes joined by a beam).
    - No overlapping elements, moderate separation and balance.
    - All elements outlined with 2px solid black stroke, no fill.

    Composition Plan:
    - Place a single eighth note on the left, and a beamed eighth note pair on the right.
    - Each note: oval head, stem, flag (for single) or horizontal beam (for pair).
    - Stems are vertical and to the right for all notes.
    - No fill anywhere.
    - Sufficient spacing vertically and horizontally.

    LEFT: Single Eighth Note
    - Note head: ellipse (30,160), rx=16, ry=11
    - Stem: vertical line from (45,160) up to (45,90)
    - Flag: curved path from top of stem (45,90) out and down.

  <!--
    Visual alignment and separation
    - Notes do not overlap.
    - Ample empty space for clarity of the outline concept.
