    BOTTLE OUTLINE SVG

    Concept: Classic bottle with a neck, shoulders, main body, and base.
    All elements are drawn with 2px solid black stroke, no fill.
    Clean, clear, and readable outline style.

  <!--
    BOTTLE BODY
    Main elongated oval/rounded rectangle shape for the lower part of the bottle. 
    Using a path to give the body symmetric sloped shoulders, vertical sides, and a rounded base.
    The body extends from just below the neck down to the bottom.
    Positioned centrally in the SVG canvas.
