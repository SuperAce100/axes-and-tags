    COFFEE OUTLINE SVG
    - All elements are stroked in 2px solid black and have no fill.
    - Main objects: cup (body, handle, base), coffee surface, and steam.
    - All elements carefully spaced to avoid overlap.

  <!--
    Cup Body
    - A gently tapered ellipse (top) for the rim.
    - An oval at the top and a larger arc at the bottom for base.
    - Sides are rendered with curves to suggest depth.
