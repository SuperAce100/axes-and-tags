    DIAMOND OUTLINE SVG

    Concept: Simple, classic gemstone diamond in outline.
    - Uses only 2px black stroke, no fill.
    - Multiple lines/paths to represent facets, crown, and pavilion.
    - All elements are non-overlapping and readable.
    - No fill anywhere.
    - Centered and as large as possible within the viewBox.

    Construction plan:
    - Top is a wide flat line (table).
    - Two sloped lines from each table end downward (crown facets).
    - Four more outward and downward lines forming the sides.
    - Bottom converges in a sharp tip ("culet").
    - Facet lines across for geometry.
    - All joins are corners, not overlapping.

  <!--
    OUTER SHAPE
    7 key points (going from top left to bottom and up again):
      - A: left table (80,80)
      - B: right table (320,80)
      - C: far right shoulder (370,180)
      - D: tip/culet (200,360)
      - E: far left shoulder (30,180)
      - (back to A to close)
    The actual outline is open (not closed at the top), so top is a straight table.

    INTERNAL FACET LINES

    Top of table has three points:
      - A: (80,80)
      - F: (200,80)  [center of table]
      - B: (320,80)

    Shoulders (sides) have two more points for faceting:
      - G: (120,180)  [left shoulder]
      - H: (280,180)  [right shoulder]

    Lines drawn to make basic internal facets:
  -->

  <!-- Vertical center line: Table center to tip -->
  <line x1="200" y1="80" x2="200" y2="360" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>

  <!-- Left table edge to left shoulder -->

  <!-- Right table edge to right shoulder -->

  <!-- Additional facet lines (optional, skip for clarity since there's no overlap and main shape is clear) -->
