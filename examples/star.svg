    STAR OUTLINE SVG

    Concept: Five-pointed classic star.
    All strokes are 2px solid black, and all shapes have no fill.
    The star is centered in the canvas and uses path data to create sharp corners.

  <!-- 
    Star Outline
    A single <path> that connects the 5 star tips and 5 inner points,
    forming a regular five-pointed star by connecting every other vertex.
    The points are computed to center the star and make it as large as possible without clipping.
    
    Algorithm (for comments/reference):
    - Outer radius: 120
    - Inner radius: 48 (approx 40% of outer radius)
    - Center: (150, 150)
    - For each point i in [0,9]: 
        - Even i: use outer radius, odd i: use inner radius
        - Angle = -90 + 36*i degrees (starts at upward tip)
        - Convert polar to cartesian for x, y
    - Connect in order of 10 points (5 outer, 5 inner, alternating)

  <!-- 
    (Optional for outline clarity) 
    Could add small circles at each point/corner, but omitted for cleanliness.
    The effect is a clean star shape in pure outline, as requested.
