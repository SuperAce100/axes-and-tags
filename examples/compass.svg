    COMPASS OUTLINE SVG

    Concept: Classic magnetic compass, outline style.
    - Main compass body is a large, centered circle.
    - Cardinal point marks (N/E/S/W) as short, non-overlapping lines.
    - Distinct "needle" as a long, symmetric diamond (so no tip overlaps center spindle or body).
    - Center spindle: outlined circle.
    - Subtle ring for degree scale (inner ring, thinner).
    - No fills, all strokes are 2px solid black. No overlaps.

    Composition:
    - Compass face centered at (200,200), radius chosen for balanced margins.
    - All visuals inside 2px stroke perimeter, no elements intersect or overlap stroke outlines.

    MAIN BODY
    Large circle as the compass housing.
    Center: (200,200), main radius: 160px

  <!--
    DEGREE SCALE RING
    Inner circle slightly smaller than main to suggest scale ring.
    Radius: 140 (visually balanced inside body).

  <!--
    CARDINAL MARKS (N, E, S, W)
    Four straight lines, slightly longer than minor marks.
    Don't overlap circle outlines or needle.
    Start at inner radius (125), end at outer ring (140).
    Calculated for each cardinal direction.

    COMPASS NEEDLE
    Long symmetric diamond shape, aligned N/S,
    with slightly different tips for "magnetic north" (slightly sharper at top).

    Four points:
    - North tip:      (200, 105) (15 below outer circle, avoids overlap, very close to N mark)
    - East/West:      (215, 200) / (185, 200) (10 px off-center, short width)
    - South tip:      (200, 295) (15 above outer circle)
    - (Closed back to North)

    Drawn as a path in outline (polygon).
    All points carefully placed to not overlap scale ring or spindle.
