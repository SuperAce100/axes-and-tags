    LIGHTBULB OUTLINE SVG

    Concept: Classic incandescent lightbulb with a rounded bulb,

    Clean 2px black strokes, no fills, no overlaps.

  <!--
    Bulb glass envelope
    Large symmetric oval at the top/middle to represent the iconic bulb shape.
    Positioned with enough bottom space for the base.
